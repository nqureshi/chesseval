However, White can exploit the weakened kingside by sacrificing the bishop on f7, opening up Black's king position. After Bxf7+, Black is forced to take with the king, and White follows up with Qf3+, regaining the sacrificed piece with a strong attack.\n\nMove: Bxf7+\n\nConfidence: 90",

White's best move is to defend against the immediate threats while developing an attack of their own.
